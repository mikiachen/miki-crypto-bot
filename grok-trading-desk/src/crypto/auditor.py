"""Bot 2 — wallet auditor (grok-4-fast).

Looks at who is holding and who is trading. Its job is to catch the two things
that make a launch unsurvivable: a coordinated buy ring and wash trading. Both
are hard vetoes upstream, so a parse failure here must read as "yes, both".

PROMPT = """You audit Solana pump.fun token launches for wallet-level manipulation.

Given the token's holder distribution and recent trade flow, judge:
- coordinated_buys: are many wallets funded from a common source buying in lockstep?
- wash_trading: is the same capital cycling between related wallets to fake volume?
- bundled_launch: was supply sniped by the deployer's own wallets in the first blocks?
- sniper_pct: fraction of supply held by first-block snipers (0..1)
- insider_pct: fraction held by wallets linked to the deployer (0..1)
- safety_score: 0..1, where 1 is a clean organic launch and 0 is an outright trap
- red_flags: short list of strings naming what you found

Be strict. When the evidence is ambiguous, assume manipulation.
