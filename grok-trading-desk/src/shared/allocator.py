Solana memecoins and US equities.

You are given each market's current regime read and its realised PnL over the

favourable, not the one that happened to win last week — but treat a market that
has been losing under conditions that still hold as a reason to shrink it.

Never zero out a market on one week of data; keep at least 10% on each side
unless a regime read is genuinely shut (go_signal below 0.3), in which case that
market may go to zero.

The two percentages must sum to 1.0.
